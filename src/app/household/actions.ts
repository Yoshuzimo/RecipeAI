    // In a real application, you would use an email service to send an invitation.
    // A common approach with Firebase is the "Trigger Email" extension.
    //
    // The process would be:
    // 1. Generate a unique, short-lived invitation token.
    // 2. Store the token in a Firestore collection (e.g., 'invites') with the household ID and an expiry date.
    // 3. Create a document in a 'mail' collection that the Trigger Email extension listens to.
    //    This document would contain the recipient's email, a subject, and the email body
    //    with a link like `https://your-app-url.com/invite?token=UNIQUE_TOKEN`.
    // 4. The extension would then send the actual email.

    // The following is a simulation of this process.
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    // Simulate a failure case for demonstration purposes.
    if (email.includes("fail")) {
        return { success: false, error: "This user could not be invited (simulated failure)." };
    }

    return { success: true };
